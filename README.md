# Floating_Point_Calculator
Floating Point Calculator, project from System Programming Courses. The project involves the creation of a software library called TinySF, designed for the MUAN programming language, which operates on embedded systems lacking hardware support for floating-point operations. The libraryâ€™s purpose is to provide a custom 12-bit floating-point representation, enabling MUAN to perform computations with floating-point numbers. The core tasks include implementing six API functions in C, without the use of native float or double types, to handle the encoding and decoding of these custom floating-point values. The project emphasizes bitwise operations and C programming design, with a focus on helper functions to facilitate the implementation.
